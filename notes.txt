questions to ask bassam :

the login screen:
1- how to center an item within a container (flexDirections:'row')(container has more than one childe

2- is it possible to rtl only some components 

3- homeScreen =>
    input component is overlapped by the scrollView element even tho
    they are in the scope , which means an element by element (flexDirections='column')


    redux=>
        should everything tha is mutable be in state or is it enough to be put in array as a data
        since it's probably not used in other screens ........

    redux important question => does attributes of the same state automatically update or must be dispatched again
